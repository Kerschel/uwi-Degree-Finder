# uwi-Degree-Finder
Potential students have little to no way of knowing what programmes they qualify for, or even what they plan on doing.
We created a application to help persons to who would like to register for UWI to be able to find a suitable degree of their choice based of what passes they have.

The login page and Main pages were not 100% integrated properly, as they are both are hosted on different server.
Login page : https://prog-c99a8.firebaseapp.com/#
Main page:  https://comp3150project.firebaseapp.com/#

The login page will redirect you to the main page when you login.

The Login page is seperated by the folder Login.rar and everything is integrated in the Programme-detector main.rar. The user must use the public folder in the extracted file to view the contents. index.html will carry you to the login page. You may login with ID:guest@hotmail.com  pw:password123 or register a new account.


The UploadData file is used to add more degrees and subjects to the database that is searchable by the user.
